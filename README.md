Welcome!! ðŸ¥°

What can you find inside my tent? Gnosis

Let me provide some depth and background about me to explain further. 
I'm a former VP from Goldman Sachs--I know... I know...ðŸ¦‘--with 15+ years spent advising some of the largest financial institutions in the Midwest on the market. 
I like to think of myself as having a head for finance, a heart for mother earth, and eyes for the Metaverse. ðŸ˜Ž 

I'll be sharing my substack newsletter (https://tmifma.substack.com) with you  and you get to ride shotgun alongside me in my journey through the Metaverse.
If there are specific topics or questions you have about crypto, just let me know and I'll be happy to address it directly.
Perhaps it would make for a good topic for my next article! ðŸ“– 

The Metaverse Illuminated newsletter is meant to help demystify the complex world of crypto and allow me to share my analysis on projects that I find valuable. 
Hopefully it will set you on your own path to success. 
Each of us must be the captains of our own ship so this isn't some stock picker newsletter where I send you buy signals. 
This is meant to empower you to better understand crypto and make educated choices for yourself. ðŸ“ˆ 

You can reach me at my substack linked above, or on twitter @tmifma. ðŸ“«
